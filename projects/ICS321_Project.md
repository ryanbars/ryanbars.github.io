For our ICS 321 final project my team created an web application that allows hotel managers to query customer reservation information based on different parameters. The idea was that if historical information was provided such as customers hometown, credit card type, date of reservation, and room size, hotel managers would be able to bettery accomidate certain valued customers and schedule hotel maintenance around times when there are less people in the hotel. 

This project was very query focused, for each parameter we needed to dynamically build a different query on the backend. This project helped me build my up my foundation in PHP and HTML as there were many instances where we needed to connect the front end website to the backend database, as well as my foundation in MySQL and managing a user login system.
