Learning Semantic-Ui has changed my life forever... now that I've written it that out it seems like a dramatic overstatement, but when you at the details it might not be so crazy to say. In the process of creating a web project there are usually two main components: the web designer, and the web developer. The web designer creates beautiful mockups of the project and then gives them to the developer to implement those designs and turn them into the actual project. It's similar to the relationship between an painter and contractor, the contractor builds it and the painter makes it look nice. Theres a reason these two components of the project are seperate and are done by different people. It's because they take two completely different skill set, the designer is usually much more artistic, they know the subtle nuances in color, how to make things look evenly spaced out. The developer knows how to implement it in the real world, hes down in the trenches writing the the actual code and putting pieces together. 

## *"Learning Semantic UI changed my life forever"*

You might ask well if the designer is just making mockups or "pictures" then the only real work is done by the developer. 
The problem with that notion is it disounts the massive importance beautiful design has on the success of a project. You can have the most amazing application that solves a problem that everyone has right now, but if its ugly no one is going to use it. Imagine facebook with no css. You can't have one without the other, Camry with a Porche engine, or a butt ugly girl with a great heart. Users are as much concerned with how they feel when they look at and use an application as they are with how the application actually works. 

Semantic-Ui changes everything, it's like having your own personal designer with you. As a developer you can build your application then using a few class tags, make your application have a beautiful responsive design thought Semantic-Ui. This is especially useful for building minimum viable products in agile programming. Being able to very quickly build a working prototype with a decent design that you can show to potential users or investors is insanely useful. The time it takes to learn Semantic-Ui is well worth the amount of use you can get out of it.

I have worked with Twitter Bootstrap in the past and I can say that I like Semantic-Ui a little more. For one the syntax of class names is a lot more intuitive than Bootsraps. Like what was stated in the Pluralsight Tutorial, Semantic-Ui uses an intuitive sentence structure so even if you don't what exact syntax you need, you can piece it together logically. In Bootstrap this is a bit harder because you have to often repeat words you have already used and the words are in opposite order to what you would normally say. For example in Sematic ui you would say 'ui large green button', in Bootstrap you would say 'btn btn-large btn-green'. I also appreciate the simple feel of Semantic-Ui layout. In Bootstrap theres a lot of weird gradients going on, where in Semantic-Ui it looks a lot cleaner and more modern. 

Once you go Semantic-Ui you never go back.
