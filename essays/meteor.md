I have a love hate relationship with meteor. At first I hated it, I wanted to hit it over the head with a shovel, drag it through an wet muddy feild in the middle of the night, and bury it face first is 6ft deep ditch. 2 weeks later, I guess its aight. There is definitely a learning curve with Meteor but its not quite the one I expected. Sure it has some syntax and code I havent seen before like spacebars and templates, but the bigger issue for me was learning the file structure and getting into my head that Meteor just knows things. The concept of importing litteraly everything then piecing each page together like a puzzle. In hindsight I guess its a pretty good way to create templates of pages then import them as you need them, but it is pretty tedious having to import every file to the index then remember to import them to the server and on and on. It's also hard to get into the mindset that Meteor just knows some things, like when you reference a specific template name in the server file, without importing the acutal file, it can somehow know which template you are talking about. The template name and file name are not the same but I guess meteor just looks through the list of all template names and tries to match things up. 

After getting over the initial hump was a pain but I'm starting to see the light. Going through an example template that already had all of the file structure set up really showed me how quickly you can get an application running. Its also shows how powerful Meteor can be when using MongoDB. Although I personnaly dont like using MongoDB over MySQL but its lightweight style really fits well with Meteor. I can definetly see myself using Meteor to deploy cool simple applications, I would like to see how Meteor fairs with larger more complex applications. I would also like to know how Meteor applications are deployed. I assume they aren't deployed

My one gripe about Meteor is how long it takes to to build and rebuild applications after you make changes. I can't see anyone waiting 3-4 minutes to rebuild an app every time you make changes. It could be my personal implentation of Meteor but everyone I've talked to has had similar problems. That being said I'm super excited to start getting deeper into Meteor. Like the late great Shia LeBouf said "Don't let your dreams be dreams!" my app dreams will no longer be just dreams.
