Lets boil down configuration managment. The question of configuration managment can go beyond the scope of software engineering to affect any collaborative project you can think of. How can we get multiple people to work on a singlular piece of work and make sure each persons work does not impeed or negatively affect another persons work. The answer is GitHub. I think GitHub makes it easiest to work on a large project while collaborating with other people. Its pretty simple you fork, you change, then you pull.GitHub takes care of the rest. You can see who changed what and when, and you can even roll back to a previous commit if something goes wrong. GitHub even has a desktop client to perform all of these actions so you don't have to worry about looking up commands and parameters. As if that wasn't enough, your project is hosted in the cloud, so any team members can access it whenever they have internet connection. 

I think that GitHub is popular because of Git. Although Git is a bit more powerful and allows you to do certain things you cannot do in Github, the tradeoff is that Github makes it much easier and convenient for version control and is overall a much better experience. I remember while doing a group project everyone knew how to use Github except for me. I was trying to convice everyone to just save it locally then we can put it all together in the end so I didn't have to learn GitHub. I didn't know what I was missing and my contributions to team productivity was inhibited by the fact that I didnt want to use this awesome piece of software.
