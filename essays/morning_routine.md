Starting every day with a great morning routine may be the key to feeling great throughout the day. So often I leave the house feeling sluggish or tired and that feeling would follow me all day. I won’t participate as much in class, it takes me a long time to get into the groove at work. The whole day I would be fantasizing about finally ending so I can go home and catch up on some z’s.  “I can skip the gym its only one day”, “I’m tired so it won’t be a good workout anyway”, “I end late today so the gym will be too crowded” I can talk myself into these excuses because of how I feel, and it all stems from the moment I wake up to the moment I walk out the door to begin my day.

Like most people my age I didn’t have a “morning routine”. I mean I brush my teeth and wash my face every morning, but that’s as much of a morning routine as quickly scarfing down a snack bar in my car is breakfast. My point is the first thing I used to do when I woke up was look at my phone and check some social media, or stare at the ceiling for 20 minutes contemplating life. After convincing myself to skip class because I was “tired” for the last time I knew something had to change. I needed a morning routine that would wake me up and set me on the right path to having a successful day.

# The Morning Routine Version 01

## Get the blood pumping
The first thing you do after smashing your alarm clock to smithereens is to stretch. Stretch your entire body all the way from you head to your neck down to your feet. Stretching gets the blood flowing and after you’ve been laying in a self-induced coma for 6-7 hours it will help you feel more awake.

## The 3 S’s
Shower, Shave, Shit not necessarily in that order. Showering will rinse off the dead skin cells that accumulate on your body over-night and will have you feeling refreshed. Even a quick cold shower will do wonders for your skin.  Shave unless you have the facial hair of a new born child like I do. The last S is self-explanatory.

## Meditate 10-min
I know a lot of you might not be into meditation but it’s something I always recommend to people and it has changed my life for the better.  There are so many different ways to go about meditating that we won’t go into in this post but choose whichever feels comfortable to you and do it for at least 10-min. The point is to clear your mind so that you can focus on what you need to do for the day without all the mind clutter.

## Eat something
Whether it be something as simple as a bagel or a bowl of cereal, you should try to eat something. Even if you aren’t hungry getting something in your stomach before you leave the house will make sure you have the calories to keep you going until lunch time.

## Get dressed and begin the day.
Waking up on the right side of the bed every morning is something I never thought was possible. Using this morning routine for the past few weeks have done wonders for my mood and energy throughout the day. It’s still a work in progress and when I see things that can be tweaked or added I’ll be sure to update this.
