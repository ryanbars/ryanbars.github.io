After the first week of class I give Javascript(JS) two thumbs up. Although I have worked with JS before and consider myself to have a solid basic understanding of how it works and what it is useful for, I ended up learning a lot more than I thought I would. First off the Jfiddle tool we were introduced to is phenomenal, I've been using Sublime Text to write code and then going over to my browser and refreshing but the combination of Jfiddle and Chrome dev tools console makes for a much smoother and convenient experience. Secondly I liked the AirBNB Style Guide, it showed me so many useful shortcuts that I could be using and made me realize some coding mistakes I've been making. Overall I like JS and hope we get deeper into other JS libraries like JQuery.

In terms of this class and Javascripts use in software engineering, I think its a great language to learn. Its especially powerful for web software. Its a great language to learn since JS has become the dominating language on the web and if you want to build any type of web application you need to know JS(or know someone who does). In my opinion its the more useful and easier to work with than Java since it implements a lot of the same Object concepts without having to worry about specifying type and a bunch of other syntax.

The WODs for this class are intense, I actually just completed my first one a few hours ago. I can confidently say that I've never described coding as "intense" until today. The feeling of not knowing what the problem will be, having a limited amount of time to think of a solution, put it into code, and run tests to make sure it works puts a lot of stress on the brain. But its healthy stress! I can why our professor describes it as athletic programming because its a lot like working out. To build muscle and endurance you have to put in the work, theres no way around it. By putting in the work every day you get strong and stronger, you up the weight and increase the speed and I think the flow of this class mirrors that type of training. But you have to be willing to put in the work, which is why most people quit.
