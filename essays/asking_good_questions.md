Eric Raymond outlined alot of great points in his [guided for asking good question](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). Although I think a lot of the points he brought up were valid and helpful, in my opinion his very long guide can be boiled down to three major points. 

- Look before you ask
- Choose the right medium
- Be as specific as possible

I think the biggest reason most people arent succesful when asking for help online is because they know what problem they have, but they dont know how to ask. Assuming you are past the first two points, one of which is a google search, you really need to focus the majority of your time on being as specific as possible with your question. Don't play around with words, be very direct with what problem you have because nobody wants to read 3 paragraphs about how you were updating your computer but then you got distracted because your friend Amy called and there was a power outage and now your computer wont turn on. Its important that in addition to your question you provide things that you have already done to try and solve your issue. Not only does this show that you have already made an effort to solve your own problem, but it also moves the process along since people won't recommend solutions that you have already tried and it helps to narrow down the possible issues. 

This that being said lets take a look at an example of a good question and one of a bad example.


## [Good Example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array)
In this stack overflow question, the title is "Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array?". This title is concise and to the point, what does he want to know? He wants to know why different arrays are processed at different speeds. I know right away whether or not I am able to help him before even looking at the specifics of his question. After opening and reading his question it is clear he has already test and confirmed that sorted arrays are faster to process than unsorted arrays, and gives proof through code and examples. You can tell its a good question because he gets very good answers, the top 3 answers were almost 3 pages long with a lot of detail.

## [Bad Example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21068763/forcing-a-function-to-return-if-false)
In this stack overflow question, the title is "Forcing a function to return if false". First its not a question, second do you want to return "if" or do you just want to return, its unclear. If you open up the question and look at the details, his question is acutally about how to use a loop, which has nothing to do with the title. Finaly his question is about something very simple that could have been looked up in minutes and might even be one of the first things you would ever learn about coding. Since the responders were very nice they answered his question respectfuly but could have easily told him to LTIU(look that ish up). I made that up myself :)

Its pretty simple when it comes down to it, make sure you do sufficient research on the issue you have before you ask, and when you do ask, be as specific as possible and give ample information up front to help solve the issue.
