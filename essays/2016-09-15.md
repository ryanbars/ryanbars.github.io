Lets boil down configuration managment. The question of configuration managment can go beyond the scope of software engineering to affect any collaborative project you can think of. How can we get multiple people to work on a singlular piece of work and make sure each persons work does not impeed or negatively affect another persons work. The answer is GitHub. Not Git, Github. I think GitHub makes it easiest to work on a large project while collaborating with other people. Its pretty simple you fork, you change, then you pull.GitHub takes care of the rest. You can see who changed what and when, and you can even roll back to a previous commit if something goes wrong. GitHub even has a desktop client to perform all of these actions so you don't have to worry about looking up commands and parameters. As if that wasn't enough, your project is hosted in the cloud, so any team members can access it whenever they have internet connection.
